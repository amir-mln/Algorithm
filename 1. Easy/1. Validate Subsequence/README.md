# Validate Subsequence

We have two arrays; First one is the sequence and the second one is supposed to be the subsequence of the first one.

We have to check and see if the first array contains all the elements of the second array.It should contain them in the same order as they're in the second array.

Example 1:

```
arr1 : [5,1,22,25,6,-1,8,10]
arr2: [1,6,-1,10]
should return: true
```

Example 2:

```
arr1 : [5,1,22,25,6,-1,8,10]
arr2: [6,10,-1,1]
should return: false
```
